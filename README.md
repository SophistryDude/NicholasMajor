Welcome to my profile, here's some information about me:

Projects I'm currently working on: 

**Human Rights First Asylum**
A database that collects information on asylum cases in the United States. Some of the highlights of the project are dynamic visualizations that show trend data on judge rulings, circuit analysis, [protected grounds](https://immigrationequality.org/asylum/asylum-manual/asylum-law-basics-2/asylum-law-basics-elements-of-asylum-law/ "ImmigrationInequality.org"). 

**Intraday-swing-trading analysis**

This program takes input data from the NYSE and the futures market to assess whether a stock option is approaching a stable trend line for stock options.

I'm currently learning: SAS, Node.JS, YFinance

I'm looking to collaborate on: Socionics, AI development, Aggregate data analysis, Poker, Humanitarian efforts and more!

About me:

I went to college for Physics and quickly found out that what I was really interested is an area in Philosphy that focuses on the sciences. I have my degree in Philosphy, and looking to continue my education with a Masters in Philosphy of Science, but along the way I decided to delve into Computer Programming, specifically Data Science. I love delving into systems and big picture applications of abductive reasoning. I'm fascinated by the idea of a universal theory in Physics, the point of singularity in biotech/futuretech, and the incorporation of AI to better our world.
